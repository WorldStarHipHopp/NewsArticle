                     Pedro Pascal has become one of Hollywood’s most popular and 
                     beloved figures, but his journey to this point couldn’t have been 
                     possible without his parents’ harrowing journey from their home 
                     country of Chile.
                </p>

                <p class="textp">
                    The “Last of Us” actor appeared on this week’s episode of the 
                    “Smartless” podcast, where he told the story in detail of how he and
                     his family became political refugees in the ’70s after being forced 
                     to flee former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s rule.
                </p>


                <p class="textp">
                    Pascal said that his parents were “young, liberal college students” at the 
                    time, and that while they weren’t “revolutionaries by any stretch of the
                    imagination,” his mother’s first cousin was “very involved in the opposition
                    movement against the military regime.”
                    <br>
                    He went on to say that a victim of a gunfight – one that his parents
                     were not involved in – was taken to his home so his father, who was
                      doing a residency at a local hospital, could help “tend to the 
                      wound.” His parents also agreed to “hide” the person “for a while.”
                </p>

                <p class="textp">
                    Pascal, who was only four months old at the time, said he was told 
                    that the person who brought the victim to their home was then 
                    “taken into custody and tortured – and gave names.”
                </p>

                <p class="textp">
                    “They came looking for my parents, and so then my parents had to go 
                    into hiding for about six months,” he said, adding that his parents 
                    eventually found a way to physically climb over the wall of the 
                    Venezuelan embassy in Santiago and “demand asylum.”
                </p>

                <p class="textp">
                    “And it worked,” he said.
                    <br>
                    Pascal and his family were granted asylum in Denmark before they 
                    immigrated to the United States. His parents raised him and his 
                    siblings in both Texas and Southern California.
                </p>

                <p class="textp">
                    The “Game of Thrones” actor credits his parents for the success he 
                    is enjoying today, a sentiment he touched upon in his “Saturday 
                    Night Live” monologue in February, when he said that they were 
                    “so brave.”
                </p>
                <p class="textp">
                    “Without them, I wouldn’t be in this wonderful country and I 
                    certainly wouldn’t be standing here with you all tonight.”
