                    One of Hawaii’s biggest stars is expressing support in the midst of the lethal 
                    wildfires in Maui.

                    Actor Jason Momoa has been posting on his verified Instagram account about the tragedy, 
                    which has resulted in the deaths of dozens of people and massive destruction on the 
                    island.
                    
                    “We are devastated and heartbroken for our friends and ‘ohana on Maui who have been 
                    impacted by the recent wildfires,” the caption reads on one of Momoa’s posts, which 
                    reposted information from the community organization ‘Āina Momona.
                </p>

                <p class="textp">
                    Momoa, who was born in in Honolulu, also reposted information that included a 
                    locator list for those searching for their loved ones.

                    In his Instastories, the “Game of Thrones” and “Aquaman” star reposted information 
                    from organizations that are aiding in the disaster.
                    
                    One repost advised people to not book hotel stays there at the moment.

                   The gala, held Sept. 22, began with a welcome from Dr. Meyer, who then turned the program
                    over to its host, UNMC Chancellor Jeffrey P. Gold, MD. The two led the crowd of 100 in a
                     toast, to all that had been and to the future.

                 Any celebration of allied health includes an explanation of what the term means. While it is 
                 a “term of art” that encompasses a wide variety of health professions, each speaker on the 
                 night would painstakingly articulate how these professions and the people who fill them are
                  crucial to our lives.

                    “The American Hotel & Lodging Association and Hawaii Hotel Alliance are currently 
                    working with hotels in other part [sic] of Hawaii to house displaced residents,”
                     the post originally from ‘Āina Momona reads. “Survivors are the priority.”

                    Momoa is a frequent booster of Hawaiian organizations that support its culture, 
                    environment and social activism.
