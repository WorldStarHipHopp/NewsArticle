                     Musician Mick Fleetwood of the famed group Fleetwood Mac said his 
                     restaurant, Fleetwood’s on Front St, in Lahaina, Hawai’i has been
                      lost due to the wildfires raging there.
                      <br>
                      He shared a picture of his eatery’s sign to his verified Instagram 
                      account on Wednesday, writing in the caption that Maui and Lahaina 
                      have been his home “for several decades.”

“This is a devastating moment for MAUl and many are suffering unimaginable loss,” Fleetwood continued. “Fleetwoods on front Street has been lost and while we are heartbroken our main priority is the safety of our dear staff and team members.”

                    While the COVID-19 challenges are not over, current data allows UNMC to take a step forward
                     to ease its COVID-19 safety precautions across its rural and urban campuses. UNMC leaders 
                     will continue to monitor local case counts and modify its guidance as needed.

                    As an academic health sciences center, UNMC asks people to remain respectful of anyone who
                     continues to mask in order to minimize their risk. Masks are recommended for individuals 
                     who are immunocompromised and/or at higher risk of severe disease, as well as those who 
                     are more comfortable masking or choose to do so for any other reason.

                    Testing for COVID-19 remains an important tool in the med center’s COVID-19 response. The 
                    saliva testing site at Williams Science Hall also incorporates testing for Influenza A and B. 
                    Testing resources for all campuses are available on the UNMC Campus Guidance page.

                    UNMC will continue to monitor data for its campuses and communities to inform its COVID-19 
                    response and adjust as needed, which may include further reduction in COVID-19 precautions or
                     requiring masks in non-clinical spaces if warranted.
